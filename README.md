## Project Description

This was a flexbox project. The goal was to recreate a mockup, only using CSS, not editing the HTML.

### Things to know

This assignment was pretty achievable, but the layout of the HTML was a bit non-sensical. The main and aside were sibling elements of the header. I had to use justify-content: center on the 'wrapper' div, and use flex-shrink on the main and aside elements to pull them in.
